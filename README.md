# Titanic-ML-Challenge
This is a challenge on Kaggle to predict whether a person survives or not on the Titanic depending on the features given using Machine Learning
## About
- I used different types of classifiers like ``` DecisionTrees```, ```KNearest-Neighbours``` and ```Gradient Boosting```.
- I used ```cross-validation``` to increase the performance of the model i.e. to select the best algorithm.
- I also pre-processed the data to fill any null values present, encode non-numerical data and remove unwated features.
- I got 79.9% Accuracy using the ```Gradient Boosting``` algorithm.
## Packages used
- scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Numpy
- matplotlib
